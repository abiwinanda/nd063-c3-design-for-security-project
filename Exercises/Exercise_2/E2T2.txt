From screenshot E2T2_securityhub_2.png you could see that there are vulnerabilities found for EC2 instance. This is due to the fact
that the EC2 instance is public and can accept any traffic from the internet. To remediate this vulnerabilities we could:
- Restrict the EC2 instance security group to only accept traffic from the load balancer that hosted the web service.
- Put the instance in private subnet.

If we check E2T2_inspector.png we could also see that there is an instance that is configured to allow password authentication over SSH.
This isn't recommended and usually mark as misconfiguration hence we could:
- Disable password authentication for the instance so no ssh session is allowed using a password.
