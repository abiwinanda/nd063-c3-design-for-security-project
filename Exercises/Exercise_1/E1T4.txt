Just looking at the schematic (without looking at the configurations in details) we could see the following vulnerabilities:
1. The web service instance is located in public subnet. It should be put in private subnet to prevent any direct connection to the instance from the internet.
2. The security group WebAppSG is not restricted well enough such that is could only accepts connection from resources that need to connect to it. In this case
it should only be allowed to accept http request from AppLoadBalancerSG (least privilege model).
