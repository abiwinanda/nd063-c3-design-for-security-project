According to AWS GuardDuty documentation

"To detect unauthorized and unexpected activity in your AWS environment, GuardDuty analyzes and processes 
data from AWS CloudTrail event logs, VPC Flow Logs, and DNS logs to detect anomalies involving the following AWS 
resource types: IAM Access Keys, EC2 Instances, and S3 Bucket", ref: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/guardduty_data-sources.html#guardduty_vpc

Hence guardduty is an AWS service that basically uses or analyze data from other AWS logging service to interpret the logs and present
any vulnerabilities in a more clear or readable way to users. If we further read the documentation, VPC flow logs is described as

"VPC Flow Logs capture information about the IP traffic going to and from Amazon EC2 network interfaces in your VPC"

Hence any SSH access such as the brute force must be detected and analyze by AWS GuardDuty from this data source.
