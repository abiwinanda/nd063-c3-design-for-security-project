To prevent an SSH brute force attack from the internet we could:
- First, put application server in private subnet to remove direct internet connection.
- Second, limit the security group of the application server to only allow accepting request from the load balancer sercurity group.
- Third, remove the SSH capacibility of the application instance. Even better, remove any log in allowance to the EC2 instance. This make 
sure the instance is immutable and any changes to the instance will result in deploying new EC2 instance and then terminate the old one.
